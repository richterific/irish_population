# Irish Population Analysis

For St. Patrick's Day, and in service of my own obsession with the Irish diaspora, I examined population of Irish descent in Pennsylvania from 2012 to 2022, the most recent year for which U.S. Census Bureau data is available. 

This repository contains my R code that I used to obtain, clean and analyze the data, as well as a link to the Tableau dashboard that houses the map showing my finished product. 

Questions and feedback are welcome.
